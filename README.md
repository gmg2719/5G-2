## 5G waveforms mearsurements using Software defined radio
I  worked with Software Defined Radios (SDRs) (USRPs X-310, N-210, B-
210 and X-300) while experimenting on different aspects of 5G. Some of the main research and practical
work that he did is as follows.

## Practical work:
 LTE and Wi-Fi spectrum analysis using USRP X-300 and N-210
 FM transmission and reception using USRP X-310
 Develop AM Receiver using USRP N-210
 Audio file transmission and reception using one USRP with multiple modulation schemes
 Frame Synchronization in OFDM and FBMC based Radio Receiver
 Implementation Develop blocks in python and C++ for digital signal processing

## Research work:
 SDR Deep learning feature engineering in deep learning for signal classification
 Real-time blind spectrum sensing using USRP
 SDR FBMC/OFDM
 Integrated MAC and PHY using USRP
