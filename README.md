## 5G waveforms mearsurements using Software defined radio
I  worked with Software Defined Radios (SDRs) (USRPs X-310, N-210, B-
210 and X-300) while experimenting on different aspects of 5G. Some of the main research and practical
work that he did is as follows.

## Practical work:
1. LTE and Wi-Fi spectrum analysis using USRP X-300 and N-210.
2. FM transmission and reception using USRP X-310.
3. Develop AM Receiver using USRP N-210.
4. Audio file transmission and reception using one USRP with multiple modulation schemes.
5. Frame Synchronization in OFDM and FBMC based Radio Receiver.
6. Implementation Develop blocks in python and C++ for digital signal processing.

## Research work:
1. SDR Deep learning feature engineering in deep learning for signal classification.
2. Real-time blind spectrum sensing using USRP 
3. SDR FBMC/OFDM integrated MAC and PHY using USRP.
